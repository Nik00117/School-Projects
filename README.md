# School-Projects
Those are school assignments I completed in my 1321L class. I am merely showing them as an example of my growth as a programmer from the very basics, to more complicated programs. Many of those programs serve no purpose outside of demostrating a new mastery of a new skill set. 

Assignments:

Assignment1A: Calucates print resolutions based upon user inputs

Assignment1B: Calucates the final grade of a student based upon the student input. Calucator also takes into account the difference in weights each category of grade carries

Assignment1C: Takes a ASCII character and prints out the next three characters

Assignment2A: Takes the number of people in the group, and then how many groups you want and divides those poeple into groups and tells you how many people are left over. 

Assignment2B: Is a basic animation calucator

Assignment2C: Is an example of currency conversion using USD, GBP and a fake currency by the name of Bisonicia Currency. 

Assignment3A: Is one of my first attempts at a story based game. The input the user provides will result in different outcomes.

Assignment3B: Tells the user what belt and grade they are.

Assignment3C: Is a simple program that tells a user if their mobile device is compatiable with the software the user would be attempting to install.

Assignment4A: collects an unlimited amount of userinput on their desired vacation destination and then based upon the users inputs it makes a decision on the vacation destination

Assignment4B: Takes lab4A and expands on use by using a while loop to allow a user to use the program many times over. Also allows the user to exit the program. 

Assignment4C: Demostrates a simple way to create an animation inside of a console.

Assignment5A: Creates a top 5 friend lists and puts them in an array

Assignment5B: Tells you what your sign is based upon your birthday

Assignment6A: Implementing sorting with methods

Assignment6B: Using methods to determine data type from user input

Assignment6C: Connect four game!

Labs:

Lab1A: is a simple example of printing out strings

Lab1B: is a simple example of accepting user input and printing it out

Lab1C: is a simple example of a basic MPG calculator based upon user input

Lab2A: is generates a simple story based upon user input

Lab2B: simply displays a pattern

Lab2C: calcuates the area and perimeter based upon user input

Lab3A: Is a caluactor that calucates the interest you would incur on a loan based upon user input

Lab3B: Calucates GPA based upon user input

Lab3C: Takes the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters and tells you how many dollars and cents you have based upon user input.

Lab4A: Uses if, else if statements to show the letter grade a student would earn based upon user input

Lab4B: Is a little program that tells you what a student should do based upon the day.

Lab4C: Is a simple calucator, with a simple menu, that will give you the inverse of a number, reciprocal of a number, the square of a number, and the cube of a number. 

Lab5A: Tells a user if they can purchase a vehicle or not based upon their answers to the prompts

Lab5B: A simple program that tells you what an integer is divisble by

Lab5C: A simple program that tells you what quadrant you would be based upon coordinates that you input.

Lab6A: A user inputs 10 numbers and the program will tell you what number if the largest.

Lab6B: A user inputs a number between 1 and 100 and the computer will make guesses at which number and tell you how many tries it took to guess your number.

Lab6C: Is a simple program the minimics a bank account where a user can deposit, and withdraw money with error checking built in.

Lab7A: Prints out an image of * based upon the user input

Lab7B: Prints out an image of * based upon the user input

Lab7C: Prints out an image of * and spaces based upon the user input

Lab8A: Displays two different 1D Arrays

Lab8B: Prints out 2D Array

Lab8C: Converts 2D Array into 1D Array

Lab9A: Example of liner search function

Lab9B: Example of binary search function

Lab10A & Lab10B: Example of using methods

Lab11A: Using functions to compare strings

Lab11B: Simple password protocol checker (not secure, not meant to be used in real world, everything is in plain text)

Lab12A & 12B: Are examples of object oriented programming implementing morethen 1 file. Dog.java belongs with Lab12A.java and Chair.java belongs with 12B.java

Lab13A: Is expanding on object oriented programming and BuildingBlueprint.java belongs with Lab13A.java

Thank you!
